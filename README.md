# PheggMod
 
PheggMod API for SCP: Secret Laboratory

# Plugin Directory
There are 2 locations where plugins can be loaded from:
 - config/ServerPort/plugins - This allows you to launch multiple servers using different plugins, without having all servers run them.
 - serverinstall/plugins - This is the same way as done with Smod, and allows for multiple servers to use the same plugin setup if `universal_config_file` is set to true
